Here are some names which activate odd behavior:
 - Anser hutchinsii
    - No data on Map of Life, but we have data on its synonym.
 - Felis tigris
 - Eutamias minimus
 - Cleome serrulata
    - We have records for both synonyms.
 - Antelope
    - It's not a binomial, but GBIF has a genus-level synonym
      for it.
 - Ostrea glabra
 - Zetes pilosus
    - Multiple synonyms, we only have data on one of them.
 - Cribrochalina chinensis
    - We find synonymy information on GBIF, but have no data on
      any of the synonyms.
 - Neverita didyma
    - GBIF says this is a synonym of Glossaulax didyma, which it also says is a synonym of Neverita didyma, so the code goes into an infinite loop unless it is smart enough to figure out that
