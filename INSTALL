You need the following Python modules to run some of the components of Map of Life.

 - simplejson (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/)
 - PyYAML (http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML)
 - GDAL (http://www.gdal.org/; Mac binaries from http://www.kyngchaos.com/software:frameworks)
    ogr2ogr doesn't end up on the path if you use the Mac binaries from
    above; in that case, you will need to add:
        /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/Current/Programs
    to your path manually.
 - PsycoPg2 (http://initd.org/psycopg/), to communicate with PostgreSQL
 - pyshp (http://code.google.com/p/pyshp/), to read and write shapefiles
